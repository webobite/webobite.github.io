# Statistics & Probability

## Why Statistics and Probability?

Data science and machine learning are essentially a modern version of statistics. By learning statistics first, you’ll have a much easier time when it comes to learning machine learning concepts and algorithms!

# Mathematics

## Why Mathematics?

Like statistics, many data science concepts build on fundamental mathematical concepts.

In order to understand cost functions, you need to know differential calculus. In order to understand hypothesis testing, you need to understand integration. And to give more one more example, linear algebra is essential to learning deep learning concepts, recommendation systems, and principal component analysis.

# SQL

## Why SQL?

SQL is arguably the most important skill to learn across  **any** type of data-related profession, whether you’re a data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, business analyst, the list goes on.

At its core, SQL is used to extract (or query) specific data from a database, so that you can do things like analyze the data, visualize the data, model the data, etc. Therefore, developing strong SQL skills will allow you to take your analyses, visualizations, and modeling to the next level because you will be able to extract and manipulate the data in advanced ways.

I came across  [Mode’s curriculum](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/)  a while back and it is fantastic! So I would first get familiar with  [using SQL in Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-in-mode/)  and then you’ll be able to go through the topics below!

# Python and Programming

## Why Python?

I started with Python, and I’ll probably stick with Python for the rest of my life. It’s so far ahead in terms of open source contributions, and it’s straightforward to learn. Feel free to go with R if you want, but I have no opinions or advice to provide regarding R.

# Visualizing Data

## Why Data Visualizations?

The ability to visualize data and insights is so important because it’s the easiest way to communicate intricate information and a lot of information at once. As a data scientist, you’re always selling yourself and your ideas, whether your pitching a new project or convincing others why your model should be productionalized — data visualizations are a great tool to help you with that.

There are dozens of data visualization libraries out there, but I’m going to focus on two: Matplotlib and Plotly.

# Data Exploration and Preparation

## Why Data Exploration and Preparation?

> “Garbage in, garbage out”

The models that you create can only be as good as the data that you feed into it. To understand what the state of your data is in, i.e. whether it’s “good” or not, you have to explore the data and prepare the data. Therefore, for the next four weeks, I’m going to provide several amazing resources for you to go through and get a better understanding of what data exploration and preparation entails.

## **Week 36: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be difficult because there’s no one set way of doing it — but that’s also what keeps it exciting. Generally, you want to…

-   Derive descriptive statistics (eg. central tendency)
-   Perform uni-variable analysis (distributions and spread)
-   Perform multi-variable analysis (scatterplots, correlation matrix, predictive power score, etc…)
-   Check for missing data and check for outliers

_Check out a beginner’s guide to EDA_ [_here_](https://towardsdatascience.com/exploratory-data-analysis-dcb5e7189c4e)_._

# Machine Learning

## Why Machine Learning?

Everything that you’ve learned has led up to this point! Not only is machine learning interesting and exciting, but it is also a skill that all data scientists have. It’s true that modeling makes up a small portion of a data scientist’s time, but it doesn’t take away from its importance.

Later in your career, you might notice that I left out some machine learning algorithms, like K Nearest-Neighbors, Gradient Boost, and CatBoost. This is completely intentional — if you can understand the following machine learning concepts, you’ll have the skills to learn any other machine learning algorithms in the future.

# Week 52: Data Science Project

If you feel comfortable with the materials above, you’re definitely ready to start your own data science project! Just in case, I’ve provided three ideas that you can use as inspiration to get started, but feel free to do whatever you like.

## Idea 1: SQL Case Study

[**Link to the case**](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/)**.**

The objective of this case is to determine the cause for a drop in user engagement for a social network called Yammer. Before diving into the data, you should read the overview of what Yammer does  [here](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-business-analytics-training/). There are 4 tables that you should work with.

The link to the case above will provide you with much more detail pertaining to the problem, the data, and the questions that should be answered.

Check out how I approached this case study  [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/sql-case-study-investigating-a-drop-in-user-engagement-510b27d0cbcc?source=friends_link&sk=49cdc679e66cae75257b955db51f4fe5)  if you’d like guidance.

_Skills You’ll Develop_

- [ ]  _SQL_
- [ ]  _Data Analysis_
- [ ]  _Data Visualization if you choose to visualize your insights._

## Idea 2: Trustpilot Webscraper

Learning how to webscrape data is simple to learn and extremely useful, especially when it comes to collecting data for personal projects. Scraping a customer review website, like Trustpilot, is valuable for a company as it allows them to understand review trends (getting better or worse) and see what customers are saying via NLP.

First I would get familiar with how Trustpilot is organized, and decide upon which kinds of businesses to analyze. Then I would take a look at this walkthrough of  [how to scrape Trustpilot reviews](https://towardsdatascience.com/customer-reviews-identify-your-strengths-and-weaknesses-with-the-help-of-web-scraping-data-b87a3636ef55).

_Skills You’ll Develop_

- [ ]  _Writing Python Scripts_
-  [ ] _Data Wrangling_
-  [ ] _BeautifulSoup/Selenium (webscraping libraries)_
-  [ ] _Data Analysis_
-  [ ] _Take it further and apply NLP to extract insights from reviews._

## Idea 3: Titanic Machine Learning Competition

In my opinion, there’s no better way of showing that you’re ready for a data science job than to showcase your code through competitions. Kaggle hosts a variety of competitions that involves building a model to optimize a certain metric, one of them being the  [Titanic Machine Learning Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

If you want to get some inspiration and guidance, check out  [this step-by-step walkthrough](https://www.kaggle.com/yassineghouzam/titanic-top-4-with-ensemble-modeling)  of one of the solutions.

_Skills You’ll Develop_

-  [ ] _Data Exploration and Cleaning with Pandas_
-  [ ] _Feature Engineering_
-  [ ] _Machine Learning Modelling_
